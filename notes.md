# Ideas

- Move to rust?
- Input markdown notes, thoughts, highlights etc.
  - Use regex matching import
  - Or marse entire markdown files
- Markdown notes separated by `---`
- Or, highlight passages in a markdown file
  - like wrap in <hl> or {hl} or something
  - So I can write first, and then later just highlight (using custom keybind)
    what I want to import
- Each note gets a context (like the reader highlights)
  - From x.md note, under this heading etc
- Each note becomes a single card in a deck
  
Viewing

- Review notes in a spaced repetition way
- No interval increasing, just a simple see this more, or see this less
- Default interval of like 3 days for new info and then once a week
